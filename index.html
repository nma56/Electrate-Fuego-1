<!--Hello maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc., you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"'--whatever that is?-->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

I'll let you explain-->
        
  <h2> My community is where I feel I belong and am comfortable. I guess for me my community is my friends wether it be in person or over various forms of social media. They have the same sense of humor and share similar interests and life goals as me. We are consistenly in communication wether it be face to face, text, or direct messages. Community doesn't neccessarily have to mean a certain place because it's so easy to stay in contact with anyone anywhere around the world with social media and technology. I still feel that closeness with these people even when we aren't together. Those within my community make me feel safe and important.  </h2>

I've always felt pressure from the expectations placed upon me by school my whole life. If it weren't for test-taking, I would enjoy learning and school in general a lot more. However, I am pushing through it in order to get my proper education to succeed in my future career and life. On top of the formal education, my different minimum wage job experiences have taught me various skills that I will need in life, such as communication, customer service, and money management. Schooling, jobs, and life experiences have and will continue to prepare me for future challenges and adulthood. </h2>

<!--Looking to add componets. You have come to the right place.>

***Add an image. 
To add an image, all you need to do is add the HTML, the CSS style has aleady been set. Just drop the following code between other <div></div> elements...and you will need to replace the stinky feet.jpg. 

***Small image: 

<div>

</div>

***Large image:   

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-large-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
</div>

***Add a photo grid:

    <div class="row"> 
  <div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid1.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>

Go back to your forked repository in GitHub. Click upload, and select/drag and drop all of you files...all of them, index.html. style.html, readme, and your images. Click commit. This will replace/add all essential files to make your Electrate Fuego. If you want to delete any of my stinky feet.jpg, be my guest. Great, now your Electrate Fuego is where it needs to be. Now go to settings and click it. This will open up myriad functions. The important one...scroll, scroll down to "GitHub Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "master branch." This will publish your Electrate Fuego onbline. It's time to spread the fire!-->
